1.1 Design

    After thoroughly reading the requirements of assignment 1, the project is asking
    for a fairly simple program. The goals of the program are to feature variables 
    for each of the primitive datatypes and a print out for each of those variables 
    with a example of said datatype in the variable. To complete this assignment I 
    will need to research the differing datatypes and how each one works in the C 
    language. 
    After the research is complete I will need to build a program under the file
    name of "data_types.c" for upload to github and automated testing. The program
    will start with the #include <stdio.h> function and have a main function. The 
    main function will have each of the datatypes assigned to a variable and a 
    printf statement that will print out the datatypes to the user. Then at the end
    there will be a command that terminates the program. 
    The testing for this program should be fairly straightforward, if the program 
    prints the information contained within the variable then the variables and 
    print statement works, if not then the datatypes were used incorrectly and the 
    code must be rewritten.

    Pseudocode***

    data_types.c
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    include stdio
    ------------------------------------

    main function
    ------------------

        datatype_1 = 1
        datatype_2 = 2
        datatype_3 = 3
        datatype_4 = 4

        print "datatype_1, datatype_2"
        print "datatype_3, datatype_4"

        terminate program

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Note: I am only listing four variables because I am unsure as to how many 
    datatypes there are at this time. 

2.0 Exercises

    I've been using VS Code since early last year working with Python so I 
    decided to keep using what I am accustomed to. This took a little bit of 
    research to be able to use properly since VS Code is not readily able to 
    compile and run C/C++. I luckily found a Quora post with a step by step 
    tutorial with testing to be able to run C/C++ with VS Code. Four programs 
    and 10 minutes later everything is working just fine. I have since been able
    to test the editor with a Hello World program and even with the code we have
    been working on in class.
